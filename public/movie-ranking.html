    <hr/>
    <h3>Inception</h3>
    <p>Very thought-provoking thriller movie with tons of action</p>
    <h3>The Matrix</h3>
    <p>Keanu Reeves' second-best movie, lots of action and cool plot that makes you wonder about real life.</p>
    <h3>28 Days Later</h3>
    <p>I love the zombie genre and believe this movie captures everything that is absolutely terrifying about a zombie apocalypse.</p>
